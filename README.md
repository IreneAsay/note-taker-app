# Note Taker App
Demo (https://polar-beyond-92253.herokuapp.com/)

## Project Description 

The goal of this project is to create an application that can be used to write, save, and delete notes based on a user's input. For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.
